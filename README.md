# securefs-name

This program accepts file name(s) encrypted by `securefs` from `stdin`, and output the decrypted name(s) to `stdout`. At the moment, only `securefs` version 4 in **lite** mode is supported.

Almost all of the code in this program was copied from the main [`securefs` repository](https://github.com/netheril96/securefs). All copyright belongs to [netheril96](https://github.com/netheril96).

## Compilation

Compile using `CMake` version 3.0 or newer with GCC compiler that supports C++11 standard. Clang does not work as of now. Dependencies required are the same as `securefs`, minus Python 3 and FUSE.

This app is only tested on the x64 GNU/Linux platform.

## Usage

Usage:

```
securefsname <securefs.json file>
```

Where the `<securefs.json file>` is the `.securefs.json` file generated by `securefs` after creation. Program will then prompt for password via stdin to unlock the master key from the JSON file.

If the JSON file is correct and supported and the password matches, program will then accepts file name(s) encrypted by securefs, where each file name separated by newline. Conversely, the decrypted filename output will be also be in their own line in stdout.

Should an invalid entry is entered, program will produce a line in form of `(Error: <error cause>)`.
